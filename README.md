# python-challenge

This challenge was more fun in comparison to VBA. More realistic situations including cleaning data. We went through numerical analysis, calculations based on values as total number of months, the net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes. We ended the PyBank challenge with the greatest increase/decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

Where I got more excited was imaging I am a part of a small city helping with voting, using data structures for counting votes and determine who is the winner based on the most popular vote.
